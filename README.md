## ðŸš€ Technical Highlights

### Core Technologies  
- **Language & Library:** C++ with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) for graphics, input, audio, and window management.  
- **OOP Design:**  
  - `Player`: handles input, state, dash, shooting  
  - `Weapon`: encapsulates fire rate, damage, bullet speed, and sound resources  
  - `Bullet`: manages movement, collisions, lifetime  
  - `Zombie`: base + specialized enemy classes (e.g., `FastZombie`, `TankZombie`)  
- **Modular Codebase:** Clean separation across header (`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files.

### Advanced C++ Concepts  
- **Rule of Five:**  
  - Safe management of Raylib `Sound` resources inside `Weapon` class.  
  - Custom destructor, deleted copy constructor/assignment, and implemented move semantics prevent leaks & crashes.

### Gameplay Mechanics  
- Procedural wall layouts for each floor.  
- Custom collision detection between player, zombies, bullets, and walls.

### Build & Deployment  
- Cross-platform compilation with `g++` (Windows/Linux/macOS).  
- WebAssembly build with Emscripten for browser play â€” no downloads required!
